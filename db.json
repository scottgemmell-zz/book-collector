One day Tom Meron, a happily married father of two who’s never been in trouble, receives a phone call that will change his life forever: his friend Jack Calley, a high-flying city lawyer, is screaming down the phone for help. As Meron listens, Calley is murdered. His last words, spoken to his killer, are the first two lines of Meron’s address. Confused and terrified, Meron grabs his children and hurries out of the house as soon as he can. It is only just in time. Within minutes, a car pulls up outside, and three men get out. It’s clear that they’re coming for him. And with his wife missing, an unidentified corpse in her office, and the police after him for murder, his life’s about to get a whole lot more interesting.",
